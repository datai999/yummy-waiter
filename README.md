**User Interface Design for Waiters at a Pho Restaurant**

Design a modern mobile website interface for waiters at a pho restaurant to streamline the order-taking process. 

**Features:**

1. **Table Selection**: Text: "Yummy Pho 2". The waiter can select the table number from a dropdown menu.
  
2. **Menu Categories**: The main menu will be fixed at the top and will include the following categories:
   - Beef
   - Chicken
   - Drinks (e.g., water, ice water, hot water)
   - Side Orders (e.g., Egg york, rib bone, extra noodle)
   - Dessert (e.g., tofu regular, tofu matcha, tofu)

3. **Scrolling and Swiping**: When a category is clicked, the window will scroll to the top. The waiter can also swipe left or right to navigate between categories.

4. **Customization for Main Dishes**:  
All options must be displayed in the base UI; do not use pop-ups.  
- When selecting either beef or chicken, the waiter must choose:  
  - Types of meat: a grid of buttons will be displayed, highlighted when selected; multiple selections are allowed.  
  - Types of noodles: (e.g., Thin rice noodles, Thick rice noodles) 
  - Custom preferences (e.g., less-noodle, onion): a grid of buttons will be displayed, highlighted when selected; multiple selections are allowed. 
   - The waiter can also note any specials for the dish.

5. **Select Drinks, Side Orders, and Desserts**: A grid of buttons will be displayed for your selections.

6. **Order List View**: After making your selections, items will be added to a list view displayed at the bottom of the screen. The items in the list are sorted by category, with clear dividers between categories. There are two separate list views: one for Food, which includes categories such as Beef, Chicken, and Side Orders, and another for Drinks & Dessert, which shows only the items added from those specific categories.

7. **Highlighting Selected Items**: When an item in the list view is clicked, it will be highlighted, and the specific category and attributes of that selected item will be opened.

8. **Placing Orders**: At the bottom of the interface, there will be a "Place Order" button. Clicking this button will open a confirmation popup to finalize the order.

This design aims to enhance the efficiency of order-taking while providing a user-friendly experience for the waiter.
